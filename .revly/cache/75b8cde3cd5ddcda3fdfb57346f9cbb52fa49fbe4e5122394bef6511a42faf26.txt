Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

This is a fantastic update to the `review` command. The introduction of caching is a game-changer for performance, especially for repeated reviews of the same changes. You've also improved the code's structure by refactoring the `Run` function, making it cleaner and more readable. The addition of the `--diff` flag is a nice touch for debugging and transparency. Overall, this diff shows a strong focus on user experience and efficiency. Great job!

cmd/review.go: Line 18:
Unused import
The `"revly/internal/logging"` import is commented out and unused. Consider removing it to keep the imports clean.
Suggestion:
Remove the unused import statement.
Explanation:
Unused imports add unnecessary clutter and can slightly increase build times.

[WARNING] 
cmd/review.go: Line 72:
Error handling for flag parsing
The error returned by `cmd.Flags().GetString("commit")` and similar functions is ignored using `_`. While this might be acceptable for simple CLIs, handling these errors can make the application more robust.
Suggestion:
Capture the error and log or return it if it's not nil.
Explanation:
While flag parsing errors are rare, handling them can prevent unexpected behavior and provide better debugging information.

cmd/review.go: Line 93:
Magic string
The string "HEAD" is used directly. Consider defining it as a constant for better maintainability.
Suggestion:
Define a constant for "HEAD" and use it instead.
Explanation:
Using constants for magic strings improves readability and makes it easier to update the value in the future.

cmd/review.go: Line 107:
Inconsistent logging
The application uses both `color.Red(...)` and `log.Fatal(...)` for error reporting. While both work, using a consistent logging approach would improve maintainability.
Suggestion:
Consider using a single logging mechanism throughout the application.
Explanation:
Consistent logging makes it easier to manage and understand the application's behavior.

System prompt formatting
The system prompt is a very long string. Consider breaking it into smaller, named constants or using a template for better readability and maintainability.
Suggestion:
Break the prompt into smaller parts or use a template engine.
Explanation:
Long strings can be hard to read and maintain. Breaking them down improves code clarity.

suggestions:
1.  **Enhance Cache Invalidation:** Implement a more sophisticated cache invalidation strategy, perhaps based on the last modification time of the repository or a user-defined TTL. This would prevent stale reviews from being served.
2.  **Add Cache Size Limits:** To prevent the cache from growing indefinitely, consider adding a mechanism to limit its size, such as an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.
3.  **Improve Diff Handling:** Consider adding a mechanism to handle very large diffs, perhaps by truncating them or providing a warning to the user. This would prevent potential timeouts or excessive resource consumption.
4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Adding unit tests for the caching mechanism and the `review` command logic would increase confidence in the code's correctness and prevent regressions.
