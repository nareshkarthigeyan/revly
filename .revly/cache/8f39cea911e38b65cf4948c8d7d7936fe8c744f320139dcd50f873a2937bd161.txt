Hello! This diff introduces caching functionality to the review command, which is a great optimization. The changes look mostly solid, but I've identified a few areas that could be improved for better error handling, code clarity, and maintainability.

[CRITICAL] cmd/review.go:130: Ignored error from cache.Save operation
Suggestion: Handle the error returned by cache.Save instead of ignoring it with `_`.
Explanation: Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult. If saving to cache fails, we should either log the error or handle it appropriately.

[WARNING] cmd/review.go:84: Inconsistent error handling between cache hit and miss paths
Suggestion: Move the renderer initialization before the cache check to avoid duplication and ensure consistent error handling.
Explanation: The renderer is only needed in the cache miss path currently, but if we want to maintain consistency in how we handle rendering (including error handling), it's better to initialize it earlier.

[INFO] cmd/review.go:112: Debug print statement in production code
Suggestion: Consider using a proper logging mechanism or removing this debug print.
Explanation: `fmt.Println("Cache hit", "key", key)` looks like a debug statement that might not be appropriate for production code. Consider using a logger with appropriate log levels.

[INFO] cmd/review.go:69: Extra blank line
Suggestion: Remove the extra blank line for cleaner code formatting.
Explanation: The additional blank line at the beginning of the Run function doesn't add value and makes the code slightly less readable.

Overall, the caching implementation is a nice addition that should improve performance for repeated reviews. Just a few minor tweaks needed to make it production-ready!
