Hello! It looks like you've shared a Git diff, but the diff primarily shows the deletion of many files and only a minor addition to the `.gitignore` file. Specifically, it seems like the entire Revly codebase (including documentation, source files, and configuration) has been removed from some snapshot directories within `.revly/snapshots/`.

The only actual code change in this diff is the addition of `.revly/snapshots` to the `.gitignore` file.

If you intended to share a different diff that includes actual code modifications for review (such as changes to logic, bug fixes, or feature additions), could you please provide that?

Here's a summary of what the diff does show:

*   Deletes numerous project files (README, LICENSE, Go source files, configuration files, etc.) from `.revly/snapshots/current` and `.revly/snapshots/initial` directories. This seems like part of an internal snapshot or cache cleanup.
*   Adds the path `.revly/snapshots` to `.gitignore`, which is a reasonable change to prevent these internal snapshot directories from being tracked by Git.

Without more context or the actual code changes you'd like reviewed, there isn't much to comment on. Please share the diff containing the code modifications you'd like feedback on!
