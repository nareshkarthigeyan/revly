Hello! I've reviewed this diff which adds caching functionality to the review command. The changes introduce a cache layer to avoid reprocessing the same diffs and improve performance. Overall, this is a good enhancement, but there are a few issues to address.

[WARNING] cmd/review.go: Line 72: Unnecessary blank line added in function body
Suggestion: Remove the extra blank line to improve code formatting
Explanation: The added blank line doesn't contribute to readability and breaks the visual flow of the function

[INFO] cmd/review.go: Line 108: Debug print statements included
Suggestion: Consider using structured logging or removing these debug statements before merging
Explanation: `fmt.Println` statements are useful for debugging but should be replaced with proper logging or removed in production code

[WARNING] cmd/review.go: Lines 118-119: Extra blank lines around log statement
Suggestion: Remove unnecessary blank lines around the `color.Green` call
Explanation: The multiple blank lines reduce readability rather than improving it

[INFO] cmd/review.go: Line 127: Unused error from cache.Save
Suggestion: Handle or at least log the error from `cache.Save()`
Explanation: While saving to cache might not be critical, ignoring errors completely could hide potential issues with the caching mechanism
